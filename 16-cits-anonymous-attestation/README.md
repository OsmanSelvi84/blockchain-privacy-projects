# C-ITS Anonymous Attestation on Blockchain

This project is a Solidity-based implementation of a privacy-preserving anonymous attestation system for Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems (C-ITS).

It models a simplified PKI-based trust architecture using Ethereum smart contracts, enabling anonymous vehicle communication through pseudonyms, certificates, and authority-based verification.

## 🎯 Goal

The goal of this project is to implement a blockchain-based anonymous attestation mechanism for C-ITS environments.

The system provides:

- Anonymous vehicle identity using pseudonyms
- Certificate-based authority validation
- Trust-based V2X message attestation
- Revocation and expiry-based security control

## 📥 Clone and Switch to Branch

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OsmanSelvi84/blockchain-privacy-projects.git
cd blockchain-privacy-projects
git checkout students/210304006-feridun-tavsanli
cd 16-cits-anonymous-attestation
```

## ⚙️ Requirements

- Remix IDE (https://remix.ethereum.org)
- Solidity ^0.5.16

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Open Remix IDE

https://remix.ethereum.org

### 2. Create Smart Contracts

- CertificationAuthority.sol
- AnonymousAttestation.sol

### 3. Compile

- Solidity version: 0.5.16

### 4. Deploy Order

1. Deploy CertificationAuthority
2. Deploy AnonymousAttestation (pass CA address)

## 🧠 System Architecture

### 1. Certification Authority (CA) Contract

Responsible for:

- Registering RSU/authority nodes
- Issuing certificates
- Validating authority permissions

### 2. Anonymous Attestation Contract

Responsible for:

- Vehicle pseudonym management
- Attestation creation
- Trust record storage
- Verification and revocation

## 🔐 How It Works

### Step 1: Authority Registration

Admin registers RSU authorities in the system.

### Step 2: Certificate Issuance

Authorities issue valid certificates for authentication.

### Step 3: Anonymous Attestation Creation

Vehicles submit V2X messages using:

- pseudonymVehicleId
- certificateId
- signature
- messageType
- messageData

### Step 4: Verification

Any user can verify:

- authenticity
- validity
- expiry status
- revocation state

### Step 5: Revocation

Authorities can revoke invalid or malicious attestations.

## 📊 Example Workflow

```solidity
registerRSU(...)
issueCertificate("CERT001")

createAttestation(
 "T1",
 "PSEUDO1",
 "CERT001",
 "SIG1",
 "CAM",
 "Vehicle speed message",
 "2026-05-30"
)

verifyAttestation("T1")
```

## 🧪 Test Scenarios

| Test Case | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| Authority registration | RSU registered successfully |
| Certificate issuance | Certificate becomes valid |
| Attestation creation | Anonymous record stored on-chain |
| Pseudonym uniqueness | Duplicate pseudonyms rejected |
| Verification | Valid attestation returns correct data |
| Revocation | Attestation marked as revoked |

## 🔒 Security Features

- Pseudonym-based anonymity
- Certificate-based authentication
- Replay protection (unique pseudonyms)
- Expiry time validation
- Revocation mechanism

## ⚖️ Limitations

- ECDSA-based signature verification is left for future enhancement
- Evaluation conducted in a simplified V2X environment
- Prototype developed to validate the proposed approach
- Practical C-ITS security model adopted for implementation efficiency

## 📚 Reference Implementation

### 🔗 Certoshi – Blockchain Certificate System

https://github.com/thawalk/Certoshi

### 🧠 Description

Certoshi is a blockchain-based certificate issuance and verification system built on Ethereum smart contracts.

It provides:

- Decentralized certificate issuance by authorities
- On-chain verification of certificates
- Institution-based identity management
- Transparent and tamper-resistant validation

## ⚖️ Relation to This Project

Certoshi focuses on institutional certificate systems, while this project extends the concept into vehicular networks (C-ITS) with privacy preservation.

| Feature | Certoshi | This Project |
|----------|-----------|--------------|
| Domain | Certificates | C-ITS vehicular systems |
| Identity | Institutional | Pseudonym-based vehicles |
| Privacy | Low | High (anonymous attestation) |
| Blockchain role | Certificate registry | Trust + attestation layer |

## 🎓 Conclusion

This project demonstrates a blockchain-based anonymous attestation system for C-ITS, focusing on privacy, trust, and decentralized verification.

It serves as an academic prototype showing how blockchain can enhance security in intelligent transportation systems.
